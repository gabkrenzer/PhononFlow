# phononpy_flow
A collection of tips, scripts, and files to enable a better workflow to carry out phonon calculations using VASP, phonopy and other post-processing tools.

### Phonopy 
[Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) is the backbone of any of my phonon calculations. You can download it here: https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html

### Post-Processing Tools
I make use of the following:
- [ModeMap](https://github.com/JMSkelton/ModeMap) to analyse potential energy surface along phonon modes.
- [ASCII-Phonons](https://github.com/ajjackson/ascii-phonons) for animations.
- [ISODISTORT](https://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isodistort.php) to connect structures via symmetry analysis.

### Workflows
You can find workflows to:
- run phonopy and obtain phonon dispersions, density of states, mode symmetries, mode animatiuons, thermal properties and many others...
- run phonopy-qha to perform studies using the quasi-harmonic approximation.
- use ModeMap to analyse potential energy surface along phonon modes.
