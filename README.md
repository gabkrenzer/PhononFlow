# phononpy_flow
A collection of tips, scripts, and files to enable a better workflow to post-process VASP calculations using phonopy and other processing tools.

### Download Phonopy 
https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html

### Processing Tools
I make use of the following
- [ModeMap](https://github.com/JMSkelton/ModeMap) to analyse potential energy surface along phonon modes.
- [ASCII-Phonons](https://github.com/ajjackson/ascii-phonons) for animations.
- [ISODISTORT](https://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isodistort.php) to connect structures via symmetry analysis.
