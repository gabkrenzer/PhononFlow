# PhononFlow
A collection of tips, scripts, tools and files to improve your workflow, or simply help you start with phonon calculations using VASP, phonopy and other post-processing tools.
Scripts and files are designed to be easily modified to suit your own objectives.

## Workflows
You can find workflows to:
1. Run [phonopy](phonopy) to obtain phonon dispersions, density of states, mode symmetries, mode animations, thermal properties and many others...
2. Use [ModeMap](ModeMap) to analyse potential energy surface along phonon modes.
3. Run [phonopy-qha](phonopy-qha) to perform studies using the quasi-harmonic approximation.
4. Run [phonopy-gruneisen](phonopy-gruneisen) to obtain the thermal dependence of phonon dispersions easily.

## Phonopy 
[Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) is the backbone of any of my phonon calculations. You can download it here: https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html

## Post-Processing Tools
I use the following:
- [ModeMap](https://github.com/JMSkelton/ModeMap) to analyse potential energy surface along phonon modes.
- [ASCII-Phonons](https://github.com/ajjackson/ascii-phonons) for animations.
- [ISODISTORT](https://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isodistort.php) to connect structures via symmetry analysis.
- [SUMO](https://github.com/ajjackson/sumo) to plot phonon dispersions and density of states.
- [VESTA](http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) to visualise structures.
